# Sign Up Form:

A little sign up form made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (for a little password validation). This project is part of [The Oding Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form) curriculum.

As far as I know, the form is more or less "designed" (there was no a priori attempt to design anything) thinking in how is going to look in mobile devices. Then I adapted the design to desktop.

The validation of the password is absent, because the objective of this project is to understand how to work with forms. Trying to mimic the sugested design, I implement a little match validator. This means that if the password doesn't match with the confirm password input, you get feedback, but nothing else.
